## What is Obsibrain?

Obsibrain is an all-in-one productivity solution that helps you streamline your workflow, manage tasks and projects, track goals, and stay organized - all within the powerful Obsidian ecosystem.

## Documentation and Support

For full Obsibrain documentation, changelog, and FAQs, please visit the [Obsibrain Documentation](https://docs.obsibrain.com) site.

## Closed-Source Plugin

The Obsibrain plugin is currently closed-source, as it contains proprietary templates and scripts that power the Obsibrain experience.

## Availability

The Obsibrain plugin is not yet listed on the official Obsidian community plugin store, as it is a proprietary add-on for the Obsibrain template. We are working to make it more widely available in the future.
